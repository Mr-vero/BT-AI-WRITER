* **Improve inventory management** by tracking stock levels and predicting demand. This can help businesses avoid stockouts and overstocks, which can save them money.
* **Personalize marketing campaigns** by targeting customers with relevant offers and messages. This can help businesses increase sales and improve customer loyalty.
* **Analyze market data** to identify trends and make better business decisions. This can help businesses stay ahead of the competition and identify new opportunities.
